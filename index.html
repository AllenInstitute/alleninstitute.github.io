          The Allen Institute for Brain Science is dedicated to accelerating the understanding of how 
	  the human brain works in health and disease. Using a big science approach, the Allen Institute 
	  generates useful public resources used by researchers and organizations around the globe, drives 
	  technological and analytical advances, and discover fundamental brain properties through integration 
	  of experiments, modeling and theory.

        <h1> The Allen Institute on Github </h1>
        
        <p> 
          The Allen Institute Github space hosts software packages that use or support access 
	  to online projects, resources, publications and data sets affiliated with the Allen Institute.
        </p>

        <h2> Allen SDK </h2>

        <p>
          The Allen Institute for Brain Science has published the <a href="http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK">Allen Software Development Kit (SDK)</a>, 
          which houses source code for reading and processing Allen Brain Atlas data.  
          The Allen SDK focuses primarily on tools and analysis associated with the Allen Cell Types Database, Mouse Connectivity 
	  Atlas, and Allen Brain Observatory. 
        </p>

        <h2> Allen Brain Atlas API </h2>

        <p> 
          The Allen Institute for Brain Science offers access to its published data through an 
	  <a href="http://api.brain-map.org/">application programming interface (API)</a>. The API, documentation, and sample applications
	  are made available to the community under the Allen Institute's <a href="http://alleninstitute.org/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a>. 
	  The <a href="http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK">Allen SDK</a> provides Python classes, notebooks, and code samples to facilitate API use.
        </p>
	
	<h2> Research & Publications </h2>
	  
	<p>		
	  Scientists and engineers at the Allen Institute for Brain Science sometimes develop software tools and analysis 
	  platforms for projects that are not available via <a href="http://www.brain-map.org">http://www.brain-map.org</a>.  
	  Code is made available through GitHub for prototyping, user feedback or as supplementary files associated with 
	  research publication.  The projects available on GitHub include the 
	  <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/nwb-api">NWB API</a>, an early prototype Python library 
	  developed as part of the <a href="http://nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/">Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB)</a>
	  project. Code developed for <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/GLIF_Teeter_et_al_2018">Generalized Leaky Integrate and 
	  Fire (GLIF)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/biophys_optimize">biophysical</a> models derived from data 
	  in the <a href="http://celltypes.brain-map.org">Allen Cell Types Database</a> is also available.
	</p>
        
	<h2> Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK) </h2>
	  
	<p>
	   The <a href="https://alleninstitute.github.io/bmtk/">Brain Modeling Toolkit (BMTK)</a> is a python-based software package 
	   for creating and simulating large-scale neural network models. It supports building, simulation and analysis of models at 
           different levels of resolution including biophysically detailed networks, point neuron networks, filter models, and 
           population-level networks.
	</p>

        <h2> DiPDE </h2>
        
        <p>
          <a href='http://alleninstitute.github.io/dipde'>DiPDE (dipde)</a> is a simulation platform for numerically solving the time
	  evolution of coupled networks of neuronal populations. Instead of solving the subthreshold dynamics of individual model
	  leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, dipde models the voltage distribution of a population of neurons with a single 
	  population density equation. In this way, dipde can facilitate the fast exploration of mesoscale (population-level) network
	  topologies, where large populations of neurons are treated as homogeneous with random fine-scale connectivity.
